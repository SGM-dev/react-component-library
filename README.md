# React Component Library

This is a React Component Library that provides a collection of reusable UI components. Each component is organized in its own folder for easy maintenance and distribution. The `index.jsx` file serves as a testing ground to showcase and demonstrate the usage of these components.

## Components

### Button

The Button is located in its own folder within the repository. You can find it at `src/components/Button`. This component has its own files and assets required for its functionality.

### Component 2

Similar to Component 1, Component 2 is located in its respective folder at `src/components/Component2`. It contains its necessary files and assets.

## Usage

### Testing the Components

To test and visualize how the components render, the `index.jsx` file serves as a sandbox to render the components within the library. To do this:

1.  Clone this repository using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SGM-dev/react-component-library.git
    ```

2.  Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` based on your package manager.
3.  Run the testing script using `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
4.  Open a browser and navigate as prompted in the terminal to see the rendered components in action.

### Integrating Components into Your Project

To integrate these components into your project:

1. Clone this repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-component-library.git
   ```
2. Choose the components you want to use and copy the respective folders into your project's source directory.

3. Import the components as needed in your React application:
   ```javascript
   import Component1 from "./components/Component1"; // adjust the path based on your project's structure
   ```
4. Use the components within your React code.
